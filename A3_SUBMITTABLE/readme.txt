Dependencies you need: random, numpy, matplotlib

Run Assignment3.py for questions 1 and 2. Sometimes, there is an unidentified bug so you have to keep rerunning it if it makes weird graphs. Look at the output on console for xopt and fopt. It'll output the graph at the end

Run Assignment3_part3.py; it is for question 3 with one pass penalty. This takes some time so I decided to print iteration number just to make sure it's not infinite looping -- you can take it out. It'll output xopt and fopt and the graph
Run Quadratic_penalty.py; it is for question 3 with quadratic penalty. Same as above for the outputs.
