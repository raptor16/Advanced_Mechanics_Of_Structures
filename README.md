# Advanced_Mechanics_Of_Structures


This is written in Python 2.7 -- make sure you have Python 2.7 (not 3.5) if not install it https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/ and add where you put Python.exe to the environment variables PATH

Make sure you have the following libraries: 
math (This should come with Python 2,7)
numpy 
if not type the following in the command line
pip install numpy

Open the code in your favourite IDE and click run or just run it on command line (Python filelocation/filename). By default, it will print out the ouputs to the 3-bar truss.  

There are two sections commented out in the main function of python. To get the output for the 10-bar truss, comment out the 3-bar truss section of variables, lines 177 to 189 and uncomment out the 10-bar truss section of variables, lines 191 to 215. This will now output the results for the 10-bar truss.
